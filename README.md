# Comprehensive Analysis of the Technology Industry

## Introduction

     This GitHub repository contains the documentation and analysis of the
     Comprehensive Analysis of the Technology Industry, focusing on the impact of
     the COVID-19 pandemic on the workforce within the technology sector. The
     analysis includes insights into layoffs, company data, and industry trends
     during and after the pandemic period.

## Dataset

     The main dataset used for this analysis consists of 9 columns, with 5 qualitative
     and 4 quantitative variables. The columns contain information about the
     company, such as corporate name, country, office location, industry or sector,
     company stage or level, layoff date, the number of people laid off, the
     percentage of layoffs relative to the total active employees, and funds raised.

     The total number of records in the dataset is 2508 rows, which are updated
     daily through the Layoffs.fyi - Tech Layoff Tracker and Startup Layoff Lists
     link. However, for the purposes of this analysis, the data was obtained from a
     curated CSV file on Kaggle, sourced from Layoffs.fyi, created by Roger Lee
     (username: SWAPTR). Also two more data frames were integrated to complement 
     the main dataset.

## Analysis Details

     The analysis is presented in a Power BI dashboard, designed to be interactive
     and user-friendly. The dashboard provides visualizations of the impact of the
     pandemic on layoffs in various industries, with a focus on the technology
     sector. It includes:
     
     1. Overview of Layoffs: A general view of layoffs during the pandemic and
     post-pandemic periods, highlighting the most affected sectors and companies
     that made significant staff reductions.
     
     2. Tech Industry Layoffs: A detailed examination of technology industry
     layoffs over time and geographically, including the analysis of the top 50 US
     tech companies.
     
     3. Tech Migration: Insights into technology movement during and after the
     pandemic, providing valuable information on the industry's response to the
     changing landscape.

## Hypothesis

     The analysis aims to understand the magnitude and distribution of layoffs in
     the technology industry from 2019 to 2023. The comprehensive data analysis will
     allow for better decision-making, considering the economic situation of the
     sector and identifying potential underlying factors that contribute to
     layoffs. It will also enable anticipation of future possibilities within the
     industry.
